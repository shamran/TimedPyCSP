Over the last years, multi-core cpu's have become increasingly more common, which has lead to a demand for easy representation of concurrency in application development. This has increased the popularity of CSP, leading to implementations in several common programming languages one of which is Python. 

Most practical representations of time in \pycsp currently breaks with the CSP paradigm, so in this thesis we will explore the opportunities of including a representation of time directly in \pycsp. The goal is make one or several representations of time that gives a developoer the tools needed to handle problems within a timecentric domain. We limit ourselves to uses of time within discrete event simulation, realtime planning and interactive planning. For each use we approach the problem using applicable example to identify key issues and requirements. 

We have found that representations of time in applications are not bound to their probpem domain, but rather the timemodel they apply. As such we have developed two representations of time, one using discrete time and the other using realtime. 

Our representation of discrete time meets all identified demands for application in discrete even simulations. We provide an intuitive and flexible solution, that ... 

Realtime planning and interactive planning have been joined in one representation as they share timemodel. The model uses the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm to plan prioritize events, with added priority inheritance to handle priority inversion.
